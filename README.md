# luna

`luna` is a command-line tool for determining the date of the next new moon. Note that this is *not* what is commonly referred to as the "new moon" (the moon entirely in shadow), which is more accurately the "dark moon". In this definition, the "new moon" is when the waxing crescent moon first becomes visible, 1â€“3 days after the dark moon.

## Plans

* Use a better algorithm ([Yallop's method](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/download/NAOTN69.pdf) [PDF, 229 KB])
* Allow calculating other new moons
* Introduce other lunar data
